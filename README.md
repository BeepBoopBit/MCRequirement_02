## Description

This program is a simple contract that contains `mint` and `burn` functionalities for supplies

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run the program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE to get started. Here's the step-by-step instruction on how to make this work:

1. You can use Remix to run the program: https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. After you are in the Remix, creat a new file and copy the code from the `main.sol` file.
3. Compile the code with compiler set to 0.8.4
4. Deploy and Run The Code

### Changing the code.

If you want to change how minting works in the code, you can do so by changing the `mint` function you can see in the `main.sol`
