# Hello World

This Solidity program is a simple "Hello World" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a single function that returns the string "Hello World!". This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run the program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE to get started. Here's the step-by-step instruction on how to make this work:

1. You can use Remix to run the program: https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. After you are in the Remix, creat a new file and copy the code from the `main.sol` file.
3. Compile the code with compiler set to 0.8.4
4. Deploy and Run The Code

### Changing the code.

If you want to change how minting works in the code, you can do so by changing the `mint` function you can see in the `main.sol`


### Interacting with the code

To test your program, you can just go to the `Deploy & Run Transactions` section at the left navigation.
